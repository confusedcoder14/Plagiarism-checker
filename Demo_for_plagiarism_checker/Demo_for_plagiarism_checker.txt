Statistics show that the leading cause of death by injury is road traffic accidents. There are a number of causes for which an accident can occur, some of them are; use of mobile phones while driving, unskilled drivers, driving while intoxicated, bad road condition, overloading, and poor traffic management.

Accident detection [1] and prediction systems have the potential to significantly improve road safety by detecting and predicting potential accidents in real-time. These systems utilize a combination of sensors and machine learning techniques to gather information about the environment and the vehicles or pedestrians within it. The goal of this system is to provide timely aid to the accident victims and reduce the number of accidents on the road by providing advanced warning to drivers, enabling them to take appropriate actions.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate an accident detection and prediction system to be used as a mobile application, we will explore the various technologies and techniques that are used for detection and prediction. The system utilizes data from camera to detect and track vehicles, and uses machine learning algorithms to estimate the likelihood of potential accidents. The system's performance is evaluated in a variety of test scenarios, including different lighting and weather conditions.
